Welcome to yet another Blocktools Learn2Earn Task! 
This time, we try to build an automated trader that does not require pesky wallet approvals and allows you to set custom gas!

**Strongly recommended**! Complete at least 5 of the 7 prior Learn2Earn Tasks here: https://medium.com/@blocktoolbox

In the below task you will: 

1. **Deploy the swapper contract that allows you to interact with Uniswap Router**


2. **Deploy a simple HTML UI that allows the user to interact with it**


3. **Deploy a JS that executes the contract functions**

**How**: 

Step1: Deploy Swapper.sol (INSERT WETH CA WHERE APPLICABLE, MENTIONED IN CODE)


Step 2: Download the html and js files to a local folder


Step 3: Open the UI via VS Code -> Live server extension (it's free) -> Go-Live


Step 4: Get a free node URL From Infura or Quicknode - Insert it in the code where mentioned


Step 5: If you are on goerli testnet (recommended), keep the WETH Contract address and its ABI handy - Insert it in the code where mentioned


Step 6: Setup a Wallet with testnet ETH on it and insert the Private Key in the code where mentioned


Step 7: Convert ETH to some amount of WETH to be used for the automated trading (leave some ETH as you will need gas) 


Step 8: Insert the swapper CA, it's ABI, WETH CA and its ABI in the code where mentioned


That's it, you are ready to go! 

To try it out: Deploy a token on Goerli (covered in prior Learn2Earn Tasks), Add liquidity and enjoy!

**Play with:** 
- Gas
- Trying multiple swaps
- Enhancing code to include a swarm (right now set at 1 wallet, expand this to 30 for best results!)
- Add a reverse swap (Sell)


**Disclaimers**: 
- This is provided for testnet use only, anyone attempting this on mainnet is going to be risking real $
- Do NOT use your regular wallet private key in the code, setup a fresh one with testnet ETH and **hide it**
- Blocktools is not responsible for the result of any actions performed outside of following the basic security guidelines listed above
